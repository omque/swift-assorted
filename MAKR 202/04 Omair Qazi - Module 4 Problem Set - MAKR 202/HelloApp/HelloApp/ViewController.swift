//  HelloApp
//  For this week's assignment, you need to submit an app similar to the one we created throughout the lesson. But instead of a "Hello, world" app, I want you to make it a "Hello, kitty" app. The layout will be very similar, but instead of entering your name, you get to enter a name that you would give a cat. Then, on pressing the button, have the label display "My name is ___Enter_Cat_Name_Here__!" and then display a picture of an adorable cat. The stack view organizing your content should be centered both vertically and horizontally.
